100 Days of Swift Day 49 Challenge

**Challenge**
Using UserDefaults to store a count of the number of times an image is viewed.

***Assumption***
Upon App first launch the images will be read in from the bundle and stored in an array as an Image model which holds the name of the file/image and a counter. Future launches will load in this array from UserDefaults so that the count can be maintained.
